multiprotocol-slackers-qvm
==========================

This file is packaged with source, binaries, and/or assets for the
multiprotocol Slacker's QVM.  See the accompanying COPYING file for details.

This modification uses Slacker's QVM game module and Lakitu7's r181 cgame and
ui modules.  Modifications are primarily for compatibility with the unreleased
multiprotocol Tremulous server.

notes
=====

When running multiprotocol tremded, you'll need to copy both the vms-1.1.0 and
vms-gpp1 paks your `basepath/gamename`.

Add the following command line switch to serve both correctly

`+set fs_pk3PrefixPairs "&vms-1.1.0|vms-gpp1&"`
